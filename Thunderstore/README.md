# ChooseWeather

# Installation
Easy way: use the Thunderstore mod manager.

or

Manual way: You can drag and drop the BeginEx in the directory Lethal Company.exe is (it's root folder). (In this case you also have to install the NotAtomicBomb's Terminal API.)



# Overview

This mod allows you to choose the weather. By typing a weather's name into Lethal Company's terminal, all moons will adopt it starting the following day.


Note: Currently facing issues in multiplayer (abnormal behavior can be expected because it is client-sided), singleplayer works fine though. I'm already working on a fix.

# Commands:
